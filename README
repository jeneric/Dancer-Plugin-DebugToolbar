NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::DebugToolbar - A debugging toolbar for Dancer web
    applications

VERSION
    Version 0.016

SYNOPSIS
    Add the plugin to your web application:

        use Dancer::Plugin::DebugToolbar;

    And enable it in the configuration file, preferably in the development
    environment ("environments/development.yml"):

        plugins:
            DebugToolbar:
                enable: 1

DESCRIPTION
    Dancer::Plugin::DebugToolbar allows you to add a debugging toolbar to
    your Dancer web application.

CONFIGURATION
    To enable and configure the plugin, add its settings to the Dancer
    configuration file, under "plugins":

        plugins:
            DebugToolbar:
                enable: 1
                ...

    You can do this either in the main configuration file ("config.yml"), or
    in the configuration file for a specific environment (under
    "environments/"). Normally, you'll want to enable the toolbar for the
    development enviroment ("environments/development.yml").

    The available configuration settings are described below.

  enable
    This setting enables the debugging toolbar.

    Example:

        enable: 1

  show
    The "show" setting lets you choose which information will be provided by
    the debugging toolbar.

    Example:

        show:
            database: 1
            routes: 1

    The available options are:

    *   data

        Data inspection screen. Allows you to inspect the "config",
        "request", "session", and "vars" data structures.

    *   database

        Database information screen. Shows DBI trace and queries log.

    *   templates

        Templates screen. Displays the names of rendered templates and lets
        you inspect the data that was passed to them.

    *   routes

        Routes screen. Shows all the routes defined in the application, and
        indicates the matching routes.

    If the "show" setting is not defined, the "data" and "routes" screens
    are displayed by default.

  path_prefix
    The "path_prefix" setting allows you to change the URL path prefix that
    the toolbar uses to access its resources (e.g., CSS and JavaScript
    files). By default, it's set to "/dancer-debug-toolbar".

    Example:

        path_prefix: /toolbar-files
